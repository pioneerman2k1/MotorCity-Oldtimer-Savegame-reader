# MotorCity-Oldtimer-Savegame-reader
Hi Folks,

i am tring to program an Windows 11 executable for the Old MS-DOS Game MotorCity / Oldtimer just for fun and learning.
I startet to read the game.stc and the game*.gam Files.
The game.stc file is the standard file for the savegames. The game1.gam for example is the first savegame from the game.

I am working on other parts for the Project.
If you are interested in the Project and want to help me out, just write to me.
